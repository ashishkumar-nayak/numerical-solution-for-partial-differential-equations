# numerical-solutin-for-partial-differential-equations
This repo contains some python script to solve 1d and 2d cartesian codes for poisson , laplace , linear advection ,non linear advection, burger and diffusion advection equation. As usuall the upwind scheme is applied to discretise the derivatives.
This repo will update by time and hoping that author will add a python src code to solve pde in any dimensi0on and coordinate in future. updates are coming soon.
